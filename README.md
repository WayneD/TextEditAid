TextEditAid
-----------

This is the source for the chrome extension TextEditAid, which gives you a way
to use a GUI editor (or a filter script) on the text in a form's textarea
inputs.

You can install it from the chrome extension store, or you can use Chrome's
developer mode to load an unpacked extension by browsing to the extension
directory.
